# Fraud Detection Model using XGBoost

This repository contains code for a fraud detection model created using an XGBoost (XGB) Classifier. The model is designed to identify fraudulent transactions within a dataset of transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `Fraud_data.csv`, which contains transaction data. It includes various features related to each transaction, such as transaction amount, transaction date and time, customer information, etc.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) Classifier
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Library**: scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RamAnand76/Fraudelent-Transaction-Detection-using-ML.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Fraudelent-Transaction-Detection-using-ML.ipynb
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python Fraudelent-Transaction-Detection-using-ML.py
   ```

4. The model will be trained on the provided dataset, and the evaluation results, including accuracy, will be displayed.

## Time Taken for Training

The time taken to train the model on the dataset is recorded during the execution of the code and will be displayed in the output or logs.

## Results

The model's performance and evaluation results, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, are available in the project's Jupyter Notebook (`Fraudelent-Transaction-Detection-using-ML.ipynb`) or the Python script (`Fraudelent-Transaction-Detection-using-ML.py`).
